    After some manual inspection, it seems like the robots were clustering
    every 101 seconds after the 77th second.

    So, the first 100 of these intervals were generated and then manually
    inspected again until the Christmas tree was found.

    Not a very analytical solution (I don't know the significance of 77),
    but it worked :D
