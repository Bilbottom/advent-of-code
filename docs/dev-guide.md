# Development Guide

SUCCESS: This project uses both [markdown-callouts](https://github.com/oprypin/markdown-callouts) and [mkdocs-callouts](https://github.com/sondregronas/mkdocs-callouts) to extend [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) with clean callout syntax.

This is mainly just a reminder for myself ([@Bilbottom](https://github.com/Bilbottom/)) on how to use this project.

The solutions for the problem sets are written in pure Python, but the project has several dependencies for development and testing.

To build the documentation (locally), run:

```bash
mkdocs build
mkdocs serve
```
