# Development Guide

SUCCESS: This project uses both [markdown-callouts](https://github.com/oprypin/markdown-callouts) and [mkdocs-callouts](https://github.com/sondregronas/mkdocs-callouts) to extend [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) with clean callout syntax.

This is mainly just a reminder for myself ([@Bilbottom](https://github.com/Bilbottom/)) on how to use this project.
